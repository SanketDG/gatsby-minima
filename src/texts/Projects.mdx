Tech: _[Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io)_

Experimental next-gen blogging platform that dives deep into architecture and systems.
I am totally kidding, it's just a blog I write with a few of my friends.

This is the first time I got to use Hugo, Netlify and a utility-first CSS Framework, Tachyons!
I also played a bit with Inkscape to create the logo and branding.
